//Eliza
/*
  elizabot.js v.1.1 - ELIZA JS library (N.Landsteiner 2005)
  Eliza is a mock Rogerian psychotherapist.
  Original program by Joseph Weizenbaum in MAD-SLIP for "Project MAC" at MIT.
  cf: Weizenbaum, Joseph "ELIZA - A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language
      Communication Between Man and Machine"
      in: Communications of the ACM; Volume 9 , Issue 1 (January 1966): p 36-45.
  JavaScript implementation by Norbert Landsteiner 2005; <http://www.masserk.at>

  synopsis:

         new ElizaBot( <random-choice-disable-flag> )
         ElizaBot.prototype.transform( <inputstring> )
         ElizaBot.prototype.getInitial()
         ElizaBot.prototype.getFinal()
         ElizaBot.prototype.reset()

  usage: let eliza = new ElizaBot();
         let initial = eliza.getInitial();
         let reply = eliza.transform(inputstring);
         if (eliza.quit) {
             // last user input was a quit phrase
         }

         // method `transform()' returns a final phrase in case of a quit phrase
         // but you can also get a final phrase with:
         let final = eliza.getFinal();

         // other methods: reset memory and internal state
         eliza.reset();

         // to set the internal memory size override property `memSize':
         eliza.memSize = 100; // (default: 20)

         // to reproduce the example conversation given by J. Weizenbaum
         // initialize with the optional random-choice-disable flag
         let originalEliza = new ElizaBot(true);

  `ElizaBot' is also a general chatbot engine that can be supplied with any rule set.
  (for required data structures cf. "elizadata.js" and/or see the documentation.)
  data is parsed and transformed for internal use at the creation time of the
  first instance of the `ElizaBot' constructor.

  vers 1.1: lambda functions in RegExps are currently a problem with too many browsers.
            changed code to work around.
