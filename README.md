## Features

 - ðŸ“¢ Monitor and announce Twitch channels going live with customizable `@mentions`.
 - ðŸ”´ Live stream card that is automatically updated with the stream status, current game and viewership statistics.

## Using the bot

You have two options:

1. You can [invite the instance I'm running](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=411670773330345984&scope=bot) to your server for monotonetim's twitch channels (it announces to `#stream-announcements`). This bot may not always be available, and it may do silly extra things sometimes.

2. Or, run your own copy by following the instructions below, and customize it however you want.

## Installation and setup

### Prerequisites

This bot is built on Node.js. If you do not yet have Node installed, download and install the latest LTS version from the official website for your platform:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Node.js, version 16.6.0 or newer, is required.**

### Installation

To set up Timbot, download the latest [repository ZIP](https://github.com/roydejong/timbot/archive/master.zip) or clone it using `git`:

    git clone git@github.com:roydejong/timbot.git
    
Once installed, enter the directory and install the dependencies:

    cd timbot
    npm install

### Getting required tokens

Note that you will need to set up some external applications: 

#### Discord bot application
Your Discord bot needs to be registered as an application, and you will need a bot token  (`TOKEN` in Timbot .env).

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) for more information.

#### Twitch token
ðŸ‘‰ **I recommend using https://twitchtokengenerator.com/ to create an OAuth token for the API.**

You can also begin the authorization flow by completing the authorization prompt yourself:
 
```
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>&response_type=token&redirect_uri=http://localhost
```

Alternatively, you can register your own application in the [Twitch Developers Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).

Please note that your OAuth token is always tied to a specific Client ID.

### Configuration
 
To configure Timbot, customize the included `config.json` and enter.

```json
{
  "twitch_check_interval_ms": 60000,
  "twitch_use_boxart": true,
  "oauth2": {
